# Tic-Tac-Toe Python Game

## How to Play

Run the game:

 ```bash
 python tic_tac_toe.py
 ```	
Select game mode when prompted:

1 - Human vs Human
2 - Human vs Computer

Players take turns entering numbers 1-9 corresponding to board positions:
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

The game automatically ends when a player wins or the board is full.

## Code Structure

The game is built using these main classes:

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `GameBoard` | Manages game state, validates moves, and checks for wins/draws |
| `Player` (ABC) | Abstract base class defining the player interface |
| `HumanPlayer` | Handles human player input and move validation |
| `ComputerPlayer` | Implements basic AI with random move selection |
| `GameEngine` | Controls game flow, turn management, and mode selection |

### Key Responsibilities:
- **GameBoard**:
  - Tracks current board state (`cells` array)
  - Provides board visualization (`print_board()`)
  - Validates moves (`is_valid_move()`)
  - Checks win conditions (`check_wins()`)
  - Detects draws (`is_draw()`)

- **Player Classes**:
  - `HumanPlayer`: Processes user input for moves
  - `ComputerPlayer`: Generates random valid moves

- **GameEngine**:
  - Initializes game components
  - Manages game loop
  - Handles player switching
  - Determines game end conditions
Example Gameplay

Current board:

| 1 | 2 | 3 |  
| 4 | 5 | 6 |  
| 7 | 8 | 9 |  

Player X, enter position (1-9): 5

| 1 | 2 | 3 |  
| 4 | X | 6 |  
| 7 | 8 | 9 |  

Computer chooses position 1

| O | 2 | 3 |  
| 4 | X | 6 |  
| 7 | 8 | 9 |  


## Customization:  
You can easily modify the game  

Change player symbols by editing the symbol attributes

Improve the AI by modifying the ComputerPlayer class

Adjust board visuals in the print_board() method

Add new features like score tracking
